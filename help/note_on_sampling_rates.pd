#X text 18 20 As PureData arrays are simply list of numbers \, they
do not have a sampling rate per se \, and therefore the frequency of
the various descriptors can only be as true as long as we provide the
algorythm with a sampling rate. By default \, the objects will take
the current sampling rate of the real-time audio \, but a [-sr VALUE]
attribute/message can be set in the object to change that value \,
should that be desired and/or required., f 64;
